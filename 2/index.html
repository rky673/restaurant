          <div id="section-heading">Sth Random</div>
          <p>Here is some random text you're not supposed to read because this text makes no sense and the actual content that I'm asking you not to read is not even there in this section. Thanks for reading carefully!</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <div class="section-content second">
          <div id="section-heading">More Random</div>
          <p>Just like the previous section, this is also just some more random text but with different choice of words. My version of lorem ipsum. Keep procrastinating through to the next section. Yes, typing all this was also procrastination.</p>

        <div class="section-content third">
          <div id="section-heading">Continues..</div>
          <p>Another (or maybe the only) important thing to notice is that the previous section heading was written in white ICYMI while going through my text. And FYI, the colour of this section heading is...not supposed to tell prolly.</p>
